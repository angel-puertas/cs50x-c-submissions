# CS50x C Submissions
My submissions for the [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) course, copy-pasted from the [CS50 Codespaces](https://cs50.dev/).

Not all of the code present in this repo is original, as some was distribution code provided by the course.

## Requirements
[CS50 library](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/c/)
